## Remote controlled software (based on MQ- Reaper)

This project was inspired by my interest in 3D-printing, CAD, control theory, and artificial intelligence.
The current state of this project contains a 3rd iteration drone body ready to integrate electrical
components, and control software able to accept user input to throttle the motor. I am currently working on
creating and integrating servo control software with the GUI to create a fully controllable drone from a 
laptop. Future plans for this project include artifical intelligence for smooth in-flight control and live
camera feed to make controlling the aircraft even easier.
