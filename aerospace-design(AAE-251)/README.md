# Aerospace design overview

The code in this folder is composed of MATLAB to simulate aircraft and spacecraft. 
Each file serves a different purpose from predicting orbits to sizing an aircraft.
Ultimately, all of these scripts were compiled to perform a report on sustainable
electric parabolic flight. The results of which can be found in the possibility
of electric parabolic flight report.
