# C programming overview

This folder showcases many different C programs for many different purposes. 
There is a total of 18 files ranging from kinematic calculations to blackjack. 
These programs are meant to demonstrate my progression in functional, 
low-level programming. I began with simple programs with all calculations 
occurring in the main function, and transitioned to more complex programs 
making use of lower level concepts like malloc() and pointers.
