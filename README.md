# Progression in Aerospace Engineering

This repository serves as a reference to my progress in my aerospace engineering degree for myself and for others.
My coursework and personal projects are included in this repository, including reports and code. In the future, I
plan to add more documentation and code as my current coursework includes a lot of programming and trade studies.
I do a lot of personal projects, especially with scripting in Python and JavaScript, but recently I have been
developing interest in control theory and artificial intelligence. My largest project to date is my 
remote-controlled drone, which makes use of a C# GUI and a C++ flight software program, with plans to integrate
artificial intelligence in the future for more stable flight.
